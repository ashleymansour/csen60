# Web Security and Privacy

## Security
-  potential security oversights
    - no user authentication
    - allowing weak authenticatino
    - not sanitizing form entries and requests
    - not encrypting sensitive communications
    - sessions that don't time out
    - out of date(un-patched) software
        - new vulnerabilities discovered all the time
    - bugs that expose user data 
- cross site scripting 
    - type of attack to be on your website
    - attacker inserts abitrary html on your webpage
    - they can steal user info and change content of page
    - if html includes script tags?
        - replace page with a new one
            - fake instance of a page to get passwords, accounts
        - pass information from the page to foreign page
            - cookies, passwords, credit card numbers, session Ids
        - download user's cookies (passowrds) for other sites
    - how?
        - attacker provides a link but attatches script in url 
    - mitigation
        - dont allow HTML to be inserted
            - backend libraries to strip out HTML tags
        - dont allow malicious HTML to be inserted
            - backend libraries to sanitize HTML
        - similar techniques used to protect againsl SQL injection 
    - Distributed Denial of Service
        - DDoS
        - Overwhelm a server with malicious requests to block regular users 
        - attacker uses a number of controlled machines, often compromised
            - hard to spot
    - DDos Mitigation
        - rate limiting
            - limit volume of request from a user
        - throw out excess traffic at random
            - some will be malicious, some will be legitimate
        - distribute traffic across network
            - by distributing load, can accomodate huge volume 
        - for test- what it is, how it happens, how to solve, dont need to explain exactly how it works
    - Network Security
        - Need to send request: GET/POST
        - Need to send responses: HTML documents
        - Network channels aren't necessarily secure
            - to solve: 
                - encryption function
                - f(x) = Y easy to compute
                - encryption
                    - ensures privacy within an organization and on the internet
                    - the conversation of data into an unreadable form, called ciphertext
                - decryption
    - Encryption types
        - 2 types: symmetric key, asymmetric key
            - both used to connect to websites
    - browser-server communication
        - can use encrypted communication in a web app
            - HTTPS represents an encrypted (secure) connection
        - HTTPS is secure HTTP
            - data passed back and forth is encrypted
            - browser and server agree on a key
            - encryption is then done based on this key
            - this is handled by the secure sockets layer (SSL)
        - HTTPS Usage
            - you should always be using https is you are sending confidential information

## Privacy
- data collection= form entry, mobile OS-provided, cookies, behavior logging
- Cookies
    - a name/value pair created by a website to store information on your computer 
    - why user want cookies= user authentication, site pref, contents of shopping cart
- Privacy Policy
    - statement saying what the web site does with any information it collects
    - generally considered legally binding
        - must obey the laws of the land
        - different lands have different laws
    - written in dense legal language
    - users may or may not pay attention
